CHANGES TO GNUMEX BETWEEN VERSIONS 1.11 AND 1.12.

1. The mex-files uigetpath and shortpath have been recompiled and the new
   versions are compatible with, and called if, the Matlab version is >= 7.4.
   Comments at the start of uigetpath.c and shortpath.c have been modified
   (but otherwise these files are unchanged).

2. Gnumex now creates .def-files if needed. Starting with Matlab 7.4 there are
   no libmex.def, libmx.def and libmat.def that come with Matlab. In earlier
   Matlab versions these reside in <matlabroot>\extern\include. The .def files
   are written in the directory where gnumex.m is located.

3. The gcc option -mcpu=pentium has been deprecated (from gcc version 3.4.0
   according to "Google"), and instead one Gnumex uses -march=pentium which is 
   also comptible with older gcc versions

4. The -mrtd flag has been removed for Fortran compilation (KJ had a nasty
   crash with a Fortran program using large arrays and could not resolve it
   until the -mrtd flag was dropped).

5. The mex file extension was changed from .dll to .mexw32 in Matlab version
   7.1 and the new Gnumex honours this.

6. A bug was fixed on line 733 of version 1.11 gnumex.m. When directories were
   nonexistent fp was used without being defined.

7. The switch -funroll-all-loops has been added to Fortran compilation.

8. A potential "year-2000" problem with mlv was fixed. The old definition
   would fail if and when Matlab reaches version 10.

9. The switch -fleading-underscore was removed from Fortran compilation (it
   is the default anyway, and just causes confusion with the switch
   -fno-underscoring, which is necessary)

10. Gnumex now locates both the Cygwin and Mingw folders (or does its best to
    locate them), instead of setting the Mingw folder always to c:\Mingw.

11. Gnumex now defaults to using Mingw instead of Cygwin, unless it finds
    Cygwin and not Mingw, for reasons explained in the README.TXT file.

12. A g77-compatible example mex Fortran program accompanies Gnumex 1.12. An
    engine demo Fortran program is also included now.

13. A new README file has been written.

14. Changes were made to "gnumex test" (possibly all due to changes in Matlab
    Mingw and Cygwin since it was written). On my machine it now runs with
    everything OK (cygwin engine does not work and is not tested).

Except for no. 1, 2, 13 and 14 these changes all only affect gnumex.m.

CHANGES BETWEEN VERSION 1.12 AND 1.13

The changes are mostly cosmetic. Comments at the start of gnumex.m were updated
slightly (and version number corrected). An extraneous file (mexopts.bat) was
removed and rccompile.pl was added again (it was somehow lost between v1.11 and 
v1.12). K.J.


CHANGES BETWEEEN VERSION 1.13 AND 2.00
1. Support for Fortran 90/95 has been added (both g95 and gfortran). Two new
   Fortran 95 example programs have been written, one in the file yprime95.f90
   which copies the usual yprime example, and the other more comprehensive in
   the file powerit.f90.

2. The Gnumex main window has been redesigned for improved readability. The font
   is larger, colors agree with Windows standard and a help-button has been
   added. The size of the box with the options file name has been increased to
   be able to show the name of the default file in full.

3. Creation of a "stub" file fixup.c has been made optional. This file is
   probably only needed by Windows 95.

4. With the -v switch mex now displays both the compile and the link commands
   that are used. This can be useful for writing makefiles to do mexing.

5. Instead of offering compilation for different processors (pentium 1-4) there
   is a choice of optimization level. This is more portable (new processors keep
   being developed), and recent gcc versions offer a plethora of options which
   is impossible to keep up with. However the options -O0, -O1, -O2 and -O3 are
   stable and -O3 includes most or all available speed-up options. 

6. There is a new default value of "precompath", the location for the .def and
   .lib files, in a subdirectory "gnumex" of Matlab's prefdir (for example:
   C:\Documents and Settings\jonasson\Application Data\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2007a).
   In version 1.13 the .def files were put in the directory were gnumex.m was
   located, and the .lib files in the current directory. This would cause
   multiple (identical) versions of the .lib files to be created (in each
   directory where Gnumex was run). An advantage of using Matlab's prefdir is
   that it is guaranteed to be writable, and it allows having multiple Matlab
   versions with Gnumex installed without conflicts.

7. The option of "safe" creation of libraries has been removed. The only reason
   for this possibility seems to have been to allow new Matlab versions to be
   installed without having to run Gnumex again, but the history of recent
   Matlab versions shows this to be an unrealistic goal. With the lack of .def
   of Matlab >= 7.4 there is no reason to carry out .lib from .def creation on
   every run of mex (it would slow down mexing considerably with no benefit).

8. The files mex.def and fmex.def (files containing commands to the linker to
   export mexFunction were previously constructed on the fly by linkmex.pl but 
   are now created with Gnumex.

9. The example programs have been moved to a separate directory, "examples"
   under the Gnumex install directory.

10. Corrected a bug in linkmex.pl. Linking would fail if the TEMP environment
    variable contained spaces (unless compiling was done separately).

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.00 TO 2.01

1. Corrected a bug that caused gnumex to fail when loading gnumexcfg.mat if 
   an older gnumex version was installed on top of a newer one.
2. Added -mrtd switch again for Matlab versions before 7.4 (the old .lib 
   files seem require this switch). (See 1.11-->1.12 change no. 4 above).
3. Corrected a bug in mexinterface_c.f90 that made it incompatible with g95.
4. Corrected description in readme-fortran.txt of how to call powerit.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.01 TO 2.02
Matlab version comparison corrected by Oliver Woodford (thank you Oliver!). This
is "Problem 1" described by Greg Lee on the Gnumex mailing list on 20 July 2010,
and it has been earlier described by a few others.

Hopefully I can work on the 64 bit version soon.
KJ


CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.02 TO 2.03
It turned out that some of Oliver's changes needed refinement. In addition
automatic correction of mex.pl bug discussed in the README file has been
incorporated.
KJ

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.03 TO 2.04
Changed error when mex.pl file could not be written to into a warning. Added
description of workaround of what can be done in this case to readme file.
KJ

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.04 TO 2.05
Added support for 64 bit matlab, and now create a .stp file if possible, so
gcc appears in the list of located compilers when running mex -setup
RC

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.05 to 2.06
Updated documentation.  Did some cleanup and organization of gnumex,m, examples,
and READMEs.
